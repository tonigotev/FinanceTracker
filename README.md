## Readme generated by GPT :) ##
### made in collaboration with kalinaterziyska ###
This is a Django-based Finance Tracker application containerized with Docker. It's completely useless, the design is atrocious and its a beginner level project for practice.
---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Docker**  
   Download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

2. **Docker Compose** (optional, if using `docker-compose.yaml`)  

## **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Clone or Copy the Project Folder**

Clone or copy the project folder containing the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` to your local machine.

### **2. Build the Docker Image**

Run the following command in the project folder to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t finance-tracker .
```

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name finance-tracker finance-tracker
```

The web is open to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) :)

## If you are into django ##

## 1. Migrations ##

```bash
docker exec -it finance-tracker python manage.py makemigrations
docker exec -it finance-tracker python manage.py migrate
```

```

## 3. Debugging ##
